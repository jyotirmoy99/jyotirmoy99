# 👋 Hi, I'm Jyotirmoy Bhattacharjee

🚀 **Senior Full-Stack Engineer | Frontend Architecture Specialist | AI Systems Builder**

I design and build scalable, production-grade applications with a strong focus on **architecture, performance, design systems, and user experience**.

- 🧩 3+ years building scalable React & Next.js applications  
- 🏗 Led frontend architecture across multiple production systems  
- 🤖 Building AI-powered SaaS systems with multi-agent orchestration & real-time communication  
- ⚡ System-thinking mindset — from UI and APIs to databases and cloud infrastructure  

I build systems end-to-end — from intuitive user interfaces to backend services, authentication layers, real-time streaming pipelines, and cloud-native deployments.
